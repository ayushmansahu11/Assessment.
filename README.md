MY TOKEN

It is a simple smart contract. The purpose of the 'MyToken' smart contract is to create a simple token on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides functionalities to manage the token supply by the user , allowing users to mint (create) new tokens and burn (destroy)tokens.


Description

The MyToken smart contract is a simple Ethereum token implementation named "AYUU" with the symbol "AU". It includes functionality to mint (create) and burn (destroy) tokens, allowing for control to user over the total supply and individual balances. This contract can be used for various applications such as token distribution, and supply control. By deploying this contract, users can efficiently manage their custom tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.


Getting Started 

Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Deploy the Contract:

Use a Ethereum development environment like Remix to compile and deploy the MyToken contract with Solidity version 0.8.18.


Mint Tokens:

Call the mint (create )function with the address and token amount to create new tokens.


Burn Tokens:

Call the burn(destroy) function with the address and token amount to destroy existing tokens.


Once the code is complied , you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy and Run Tranctions" tab in the left hand sidebar. There you can mint the token in  the desired address and you can burn the tokens of the desired address. There will be control over total supply and individual balances.
